    <h2>2. Enchiladas</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        Enchiladas are a traditional Mexican dish that consists of rolled
        tortillas filled with various ingredients such as shredded chicken,
        beef, cheese, beans, or vegetables. The enchiladas are then topped with
        chili sauce and melted cheese, and often served with rice, beans, and
        sour cream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enchiladas date back to the Aztec civilization in Mexico, where corn
        tortillas were filled with a variety of foods, such as fish, beans and
        turkey. The dish developed over time, and there are now numerous
        regional variations, including the mole enchiladas from Oaxaca and the
        green sauce version from Mexico City. Enchiladas are made by heating the
        tortillas, stuffing them with the desired ingredients, rolling them up,
        and then slathering them in sauce and cheese. The dish is then placed in
        the oven and heated through.
      </p>
      <p>
        For lunch, dinner, or any other time of the day, enchiladas are a
        filling and hearty dish. They can be prepared in advance and warmed up,

    <h2>3. Guacamole</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        The ingredients for the well-known Mexican dip guacamole are mashed ripe
        avocados, lime juice, tomato, onion, cilantro, and diced avocados. It is
        frequently served with tortilla chips or used as a topping for tacos,
        burritos, and other Mexican dishes. It is a delectable and healthy
        substitute for conventional dips and sauces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Aztecs are credited with inventing guacamole because they were known
        to mash avocados and combine them with other ingredients to make a dip
        or sauce. The name of the dish was "ahuacamolli," which translates to
        "avocado sauce." Guacamole is relatively easy to make and only needs a
        few ingredients. Utilising ripe avocados, fresh lime juice, and premium
        ingredients are essential to making a delicious guacamole. Diced mango,
        jalapeo peppers, garlic, and other ingredients can be added or
        subtracted from the recipe to suit personal preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone can enjoy guacamole because it is a delicious and healthy snack
        that has gained popularity all over the world. It can be made in a

    <h2>4. Chiles Rellenos</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        Traditional Mexican food known as "Chiles Rellenos" consists of whole
        green chilies that have been stuffed with cheese or meat and then
        deep-fried until crispy. The dish is a favourite on the menus of Mexican
        restaurants all over the world and is frequently served with salsa or
        tomato sauce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chiles Rellenos have their roots in the colonial era of Mexico, when
        Spanish settlers taught the native population how to fry food and make
        cheese. Regional variations, such as the use of pork or beef as a
        filling or the addition of nuts and fruits, emerged as the dish changed
        over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roasting and peeling the chilies, stuffing them with the preferred
        filling, dredging them in an egg batter, and frying them until golden
        brown are all steps in the preparation of Chiles Rellenos. The meal is
        delicious and filling and is ideal for special occasions or weekend
        dinners, but it does require some skill and patience to prepare. A
        flavorful and filling dish that demonstrates the breadth of Mexican
        cuisine is chile rellenos. It can be altered to suit personal
        preferences and is a great way to use up leftover ingredients.

    <h2>5. Tamales</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        Tamales are a common type of traditional Mexican food. They are made of
        steamed masa harina (corn dough), which is frequently filled with meat,
        poultry, cheese or vegetables. The filling is then encased in a corn
        husk or banana leaf. In Mexico and Central America, tamales are a common
        dish that is frequently served on holidays and other special occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tamale consumption by the native populations of Mexico and Central
        America can be traced back to the pre-Columbian era. Because they have a
        long shelf life, tamales were frequently used as portable food for
        soldiers and travellers. The labor-intensive process of making tamales
        includes several steps, such as making the masa dough, preparing the
        filling, and putting the tamales together. After being steam-cooked, the
        tamales can be served with salsa, hot sauce, or guacamole.
      </p>
      <p>
        A delicious and adaptable dish, tamales can be enjoyed for breakfast,
        lunch, or dinner. They are frequently offered during special occasions
        like Christmas and Dia de los Muertos and are a wonderful way to unite
        loved ones.
