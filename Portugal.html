    <h1>Portugal</h1>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        Portugal's cuisine is a blend of Mediterranean and Atlantic influences,
        with a rich history dating back to the Age of Exploration. The country's
        cuisine features seafood, cured meats, bread, wine, and pastries, among
        other specialties. The following is a list of foods you can eat in
        Portugal:

      <li>Bacalhau</li>
      <li>Cozido</li>
      <li>Pastel de Nata</li>

      <li>Sardinhas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1. Bacalhau</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        One of the oldest and most cherished dishes in Portuguese cuisine is
        bacalhau. It is made with salted cod that has been cooked in a variety
        of ways after being soaked in water to remove extra salt. Bacalhau
        dishes are popular throughout Portugal, and each region has a
        distinctive method of making them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bacalhau à Brás, a dish made with shredded cod, potatoes, eggs, and
        onions, and Bacalhau com Natas, a creamy casserole made with cod,
        potatoes, cream, and onions, are two examples of popular Bacalhau
        dishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Portuguese fishermen first sailed to Newfoundland to catch cod in the
        15th century, beginning the long Portuguese history of bacalhau. After
        that, the fish was salted and prepared for the lengthy trip home.
        Bacalhau is a dish that is loved by people of all ages and backgrounds
        and is still a significant component of Portuguese cuisine and culture
        today.

        Portugal gave birth to the beloved dessert known as pastel de nata,

        The dessert's illustrious past begins in the early 19th century, when
        monks in Lisbon invented it. The pastry's recipe was kept a closely
        guarded secret, but it eventually left the monastery's walls and gained
        popularity among the locals. People of all ages enjoy Pastel de Nata,
        which can now be found in bakeries and cafes all over Portugal.

        pastry for anyone travelling to Portugal, and many people from all over
        the world have tried to make their own versions of the recipe. Pastel de
        Nata has won the hearts and palates of people all over the world despite

        A national symbol in Portugal, the Francesinha is a traditional dish

        bread, gammon, linguica sausage and steak complete the sandwich. The
        sandwich is a popular dish among both locals and visitors because it is
        frequently served with a side of french fries and a cold beer.

        both nations in one sandwich. The outcome was a filling and tasty
        sandwich that quickly gained popularity in Porto and elsewhere. The
        sandwich has many variations today, with every restaurant giving the
        recipe their own spin.
