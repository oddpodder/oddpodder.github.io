    <h1>Brazil</h1>
    <div style="width: 65%">

        Brazilian cuisine has a long history that is deeply influenced by its
        indigenous, African, and European cultures, creating a distinctive
        fusion of tastes and ingredients. Brazil's food culture has developed
        and grown over time, reflecting the nation's extensive culinary history
        and ongoing experimentation. The following is a list of foods you can

    <h2>1. Acarajé</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        Popular Brazilian street food known as acarajé was first produced in the
        nation's northeast. Black-eyed peas are used to make it, which are first
        ground into a paste, then formed into balls and deep-fried in dendê oil.
        Typically, the fritters are filled with shrimp, vatapá, and caruru,
        which are all flavorful and spicy fillings that go well with the
        acarajé's crispy exterior.
      </p>
      <p>
        This dish was brought to Brazil during the slave trade and has roots in
        West African cuisine. The baianas, or women who sell acarajé, are a
        familiar sight in Brazilian cities and are typically dressed in
        traditional attire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brazil is home to many popular street food vendors, especially during
        celebrations and outdoor events. Additionally, it is offered in dining
        establishments and can be modified to include vegetarian or vegan
        fillings. Delicious and historically significant, acarajé has come to
        represent Bahian culture and Brazilian cuisine.

    <h2>2. Coxinha</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        The common Brazilian snack known as coxinha is made of deep-fried dough
        that is stuffed with cheese or chicken. The history of Coxinha begins in
        the state of So Paulo in the nineteenth century.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to legend, the snack was invented by Princess Isabel, the
        daughter of Emperor Pedro II, who was passing through the region and
        stopped at a small restaurant to eat a dish of chicken thighs. She asked
        the cook to make a snack that would be simpler to eat because she found
        it difficult to eat the dish with her hands. The Coxinha was created
        when the cook formed the dough into the shape of a chicken thigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the snack spread throughout Brazil and established itself as
        a mainstay at gatherings, festivals, and food stands. Coxinha is now
        available in a variety of flavours and forms, and it is loved by people
        of all ages all over the nation.

    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        Brazil's national dish, feijoada, is a stew made with beans, meat, and
        vegetables. Its beginnings can be found in the 16th century, when
        Portuguese colonisers introduced pork and black beans to Brazil. The
        leftover meat and beans from the slaves' masters are said to have been
        used in the initial preparation of feijoada.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feijoada is a dish that originated in Brazil and has since been modified
        to suit various regional and culinary preferences. The usual
        accompaniments are rice, farofa (toasted cassava flour), and orange
        slices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feijoada is frequently served at special events like weddings,
        birthdays, and national holidays because it is revered today as a
        representation of Brazilian identity and culture. The Brazilian Ministry
        of Culture formally declared feijoada to be the country of Brazil's
        national dish in 2003.
