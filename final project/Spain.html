    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Paella</li>
      <li>Tortilla española</li>
      <li>Gazpacho</li>
      <li>Churros con chocolate</li>
      <li>Jamón ibérico</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1. Paella</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        The popular dish paella comes from the Valencian region of Spain.
        Usually, saffron-infused rice, a variety of fresh seafood, including
        prawns, mussels, and clams, as well as a mix of vegetables, including
        peppers, onions, and tomatoes, are used to make it. Chicken or rabbit
        meat may also be used in some variations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paella's beginnings can be traced to the 18th century, when labourers in
        the fields first prepared it over an open flame using ingredients from
        the area. Today, with numerous regional variations and interpretations,
        it is a common dish in Spain and is loved by people all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paella is frequently prepared and served in a sizable shallow pan known
        as a paellera, which contributes to the development of the dish's
        distinctive crispy bottom layer of rice, or socarrat. It is frequently
        consumed as a group dish, with diners gathered around the pan to share
        in the dish's scrumptious and enticing flavours. Paella is still a proud
        representation of Spanish culture and cuisine and is a delicacy that
        every traveller to the nation should try.

    <h2>2. Tortilla española</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        The traditional Spanish dish tortilla espaola, also known as tortilla de
        patatas, has gained popularity all over the world. With just potatoes,
        onions, eggs, and olive oil as ingredients, it is essentially a potato
        omelette. It is a dish that can be eaten as a sandwich filling, as a
        tapa or appetiser, or as a main course. Although its exact origins are
        unknown, tortilla espaola is thought to have started in northern Spain,
        specifically in the Basque Country. Because it is filling and uses
        straightforward ingredients that are easily accessible, it became a
        well-liked dish during the Spanish Civil War when food was scarce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinly sliced potatoes and onions are sautéed until they are soft and
        golden to make a tortilla espaola. They are then combined with beaten
        eggs and fried in a frying pan until the bottom is golden brown and the
        egg is set. The tortilla is then turned over and cooked until fully
        cooked on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        A delicious and comforting meal that is suitable for any time of day is
        tortilla espaola. It is a perfect example of Spain's traditional
        cuisine, which is straightforward but flavorful.

    <h2>3. Gazpacho</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        The cold soup known as gazpacho was created in the Andalusia region of
        southern Spain. Fresh, raw vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, onions,
        and cucumbers, along with bread crumbs, olive oil, and vinegar are used
        to make this flavorful and reviving dish. Since it is typically served
        cold, it is the ideal dish for warm summer days.
      </p>
      <p>
        When gazpacho was first created, it was known as "cucumis" and dates
        back to the Roman Empire. The dish's origins are thought to have been in
        the 19th century, when the ingredients were crushed together in a mortar
        and pestle to create the modern version of gazpacho. Today, blenders and
        other contemporary kitchen appliances are used to make gazpacho.
      </p>
      <p>
        A nutritious and tasty dish that is rich in vitamins and minerals is
        gazpacho. Additionally, it is a flexible dish that can be tailored to
        each person's preferences. Other variations might be spicier or have a
        different texture, while others might contain watermelon, grapes, or
        almonds. Despite the variations, gazpacho is still a popular dish in
        Spain and is loved by both residents and tourists.

    <h2>4. Churros con chocolate</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        A common dessert in Spain is called churros con chocolate, which
        consists of crispy fried dough that is typically served with a rich and
        velvety chocolate dipping sauce. A straightforward dough consisting of
        flour, water, and salt is used to make churros; this dough is then piped
        through a star-shaped nozzle and deep-fried until golden brown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Churros have their roots in Spain and Portugal, where they were first
        created by shepherds who needed a quick and easy snack that they could
        easily pack in their bags. Churros are a popular snack food that
        originated in Spain and have since spread throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Spain, churros con chocolate are frequently offered for breakfast or
        as a late-night snack. High-quality dark chocolate is typically used to
        make the chocolate dipping sauce, which is then melted with cream and a
        little bit of sugar to give it a rich and velvety consistency. Churros
        are a popular dessert among both locals and visitors because of their
        perfect marriage with warm chocolate sauce.

    <h2>5. Jamón ibérico</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        The Iberian pig, a breed of pig that is indigenous to the Iberian
        Peninsula of Spain and Portugal, is the source of the cured ham known as
        jamón ibérico. One of the finest hams in the world, this delicacy is
        prized for its deep flavour, tender texture, and distinctive aroma.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the flavour and texture goals, the meat is salted and cured
        for several months or even years to produce Jamón ibérico. The process
        of curing is a delicate and precise art that calls for knowledge and
        expertise. After that, the gammon is thinly sliced and offered as an
        appetiser or a main dish.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mainstay of Spanish cooking, jamón ibérico is frequently served with
        bread, cheese, or olives. The best Jamón ibérico comes from pigs that
        have been raised on a diet of acorns and free-range pasture, though the
        quality of the ham can vary depending on the diet of the pig and the
        region where it was raised. Jamón ibérico is still a well-liked delicacy
        in Spain and throughout the world despite its hefty price tag. Even the
        most discriminating palates will be impressed by its rich and complex
        flavour.
