    <h2>4. Meze</h2>
    <div style="width: 65%">
      <p>
        Turkey is one of the countries in the Mediterranean that enjoys the
        eating style known as meze. It consists of small plates or dishes that
        are offered as appetisers or snacks, usually paired with alcoholic
        beverages and shared with friends and family. Simple salads and dips to
        more intricate dishes like stuffed grape leaves or fried eggplant can
        all be found in meze.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meze has a long history in Turkish cuisine and plays a significant role
        in celebrations and social gatherings. Meze was supposedly first served
        to sultans and other high-ranking officials in the Ottoman Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hummus, which is made from mashed chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, and
        garlic, is one of the most well-liked meze dishes. Dolma is another
        well-liked dish, which consists of stuffed vegetables like grape leaves,
        bell peppers, or eggplants that have been filled with a combination of
        rice, herbs, and spices. Tzatziki, a yoghurt and cucumber dip, and
        saganaki, a fried cheese dish, are two additional typical meze dishes. A
        glass of rak, a traditional Turkish alcoholic beverage resembling ouzo
        or pastis, is the ideal accompaniment to meze. It is a fantastic way to
        sample the savoury flavours and interesting ingredients found in Turkish
        cuisine.
